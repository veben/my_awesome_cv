I possess extensive knowledge and hands-on experience with a wide array of technologies, including cloud computing, Java and Python development, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, serverless architecture, microservices, and containers. This expertise enables me to effectively navigate complex technical landscapes.

Currently, I work for a fast-growing company, engaging with major corporations, including Global 500 and CAC40 companies. My role as a Technical Presales allows me to highlight a platform's technical strengths in crucial areas such as security, performance, flexibility, and availability.

I thrive in challenging environments and enjoy learning new technologies and tools. As a servant leader, I value a collaborative and supportive work environment, fostering teamwork and mutual growth.
